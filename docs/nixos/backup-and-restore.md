# Backup and restore

The following service modules support backups:

- [Geth](./running-geth.md)
- [Prysm Beacon](./running-prysm-beacon.md)

Backup and restore functionality is implemented with [Restic](https://restic.net/).

## Storage providers

At the time of writing [Restic supports](https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/stable/030_preparing_a_new_repo.html) the following storage backends:

- Local
- SFTP
- REST Server
- Amazon S3
- Minio Server
- Wasabi
- Alibaba Cloud Object Storage System
- OpenStack Swift
- Backblaze B3
- Microsoft Azure Blob Storage
- Google Cloud Storage
- Other services vis RClone

## Configuring backups

Backup options are set inside the `backup` section of supporting modules.

```nix title="backup.nix"
{ pkgs, ...}: {
  services.ethereum.geth.sepolia = {
    ...
    backup = {
      enable = true;
      schedule = "0/1:00:00";
      restic = {
        repository = "s3:http://dione:9000/geth-sepolia";
        passwordFile = sops.secrets.restic_password.path;
        environmentFile = sops.secrets.restic_env.path;
      };
    };
  };
}
```

By default, backups are scheduled daily. This can be modified through the [schedule](./modules/geth.md#servicesethereumgethnamebackupschedule) option which follows the same format as [systemd.time](https://manpages.org/systemdtime/7).

To access a Restic repository, a password (also called a key) must be specified. This can be done via `restic.passwordFile`.

And since Restic can be configured with a wide variety of storage providers, an environment file can be provided to accommodate their configuration.
When using an [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) backend for example the environment file might look like this:

```env title="aws.env"
AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=eu-west-1
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=my_access_key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=my_secret_key
```

For a detailed list of options please [see here](./modules/geth.md#servicesethereumgethnamebackupenable).

### Systemd services

When backups are enabled several new Systemd services and timers will be introduced to facilitate the backup process.

For an instance of Geth named `sepolia` for example, the following services will be added:

- `geth-sepolia-metadata.service` which captures metadata such as chain height and persists it in the state directory.
- `geth-sepolia-metadata.timer` which triggers the metadata service every 10 seconds by default. This interval is configurable via [metadata.interval](./modules/geth.md#servicesethereumgethnamebackupmetadatainterval).
- `geth-sepolia-backup.service` which is responsible for stopping `geth-sepolia.service`, backing up its state directory, and restarting it.
- `geth-sepolia-backup.timer` which triggers the backup service once daily by default. This schedule is configurable via [backup.schedule](./modules/geth.md#servicesethereumgethnamebackupschedule).

## Restoring from backup

Restore options are set inside the `restore` section of supporting modules and share many of the same config options as
[backups](#configuring-backups).

```nix title="restore.nix"
{ pkgs, ...}: {
  services.ethereum.geth.sepolia = {
    ...
    restore = {
      enable = true;
      snapshot = "latest";
      restic = {
        repository = "s3:http://dione:9000/geth-sepolia";
        passwordFile = sops.secrets.restic_password.path;
        environmentFile = sops.secrets.restic_env.path;
      };
    };
  };
}
```

The one key difference is the `snapshot` option which details which snapshot to restore from. This can be `latest` as
seen in the example above, or a specific snapshot id as listed by running `restic snapshots`:

```terminal
‚ùØ restic snapshots -c | head
ID        Time                 Host    Tags

```

**Note:** restoring from backup will _only be attempted_ if the state directory for the service in question is empty. The
presence of any files will cause the restoration attempt to be aborted.

This means it is safe to leave the restore config in place as it only has an effect when initialising a fresh instance.
